# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
This project aims to analyze the relationship between Bike Sharing and Vehicle Registrations in Munich. 
In recent years, bike sharing has become an increasingly popular mode of transportation in many cities around the world, including Munich. One potential benefit of bike sharing is that it can help reduce the number of cars on the road, which in turn can have a positive impact on traffic congestion, air pollution, and other factors. In this project, I will analyze the relationship between bike sharing and vehicle registrations in Munich to determine whether bike sharing has had an impact on the number of cars on the road.


## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
The analysis will help us to examine how bike sharing usage and vehicle registrations have changed over time, and how they are related to each other, also by performing predictive modeling we can forecast future bike sharing and vehicle registration trends.
## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

* Data Type: XLSX
Short description.
The city of Munich built six stations to measure bike traffic and weather conditions at different locations. The data is provided monthly as follows:

traffic data for each station in 15 minutes intervals,
daily weather and traffic data for each station,
list of measuring stations with coordinates.
This dataset provides all available data consolidated starting from the first month available (January 2017).
